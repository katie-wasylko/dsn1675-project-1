  <p>I am a second year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I love drawing, taking photographs and music. You'll either find me working on a project, hiking, nose deep in a book or battling my cat for my desk chair.</p>
  <p>After I've completed the Graphic Design program I hope to go back to school and take the Illustration course at Algonquin College so that I am able to become an illustrator and work on Graphic Novels.
